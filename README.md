I'm building a RESTful web application that performs CRUD operations to a SQL database, 
in "classic" ASP.NET (plus some nice JavaScript libraries) in order to dwelve deeper and more fully understand 
the foundation ASP.NET Core was built upon, following a great course on Udemy from Mosh Hamedani.



### Pagination, sorting, & search
The index tables feature sorting, pagination, and search - 
made easy (and highly customizable) thanks to the DataTables plugin!

### Client & server side validations
When creating a new customer, each form input is validated - 
either using default ASP validation or custom business rules like shown below!

### Action prompts
Make your users think twice before doing something they (maybe) shouldn't - 
easily customizable prompts using the Bootbox library for jQuery!
