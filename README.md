I'm building a RESTful web application that performs CRUD operations to a SQL database, 
in classic ASP.NET (plus some nice libraries) in order to dwelve deeper and more fully understand 
the foundation ASP.NET Core was built upon, following a great course on Udemy from Mosh Hamedani.

The index tables feature sorting, pagination, and search - thank you DataTables!

When creating a new customer, each form input is validated - 
either using default ASP validation or custom business rules like shown below!
